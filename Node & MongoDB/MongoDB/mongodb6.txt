Update Operations
Like create operations, update operations operate on a single collection, and they are
 atomic at a single document level. An update operation takes filters and criteria to 
 select the documents you want to update.

You should be careful when updating documents, as updates are permanent and 
can’t be rolled back. This applies to delete operations as well.

For MongoDB CRUD, there are three different methods of updating documents:

db.collection.updateOne()
db.collection.updateMany()
db.collection.replaceOne()
updateOne()
We can update a currently existing record and change a single document with an update
operation. To do this, we use the updateOne() method on a chosen collection, which 
here is “RecordsDB.” To update a document, we provide the method with two arguments:
 an update filter and an update action.

The update filter defines which items we want to update, and the update action defines how to update those items. We first pass in the update filter. Then, we use the “$set” key and provide the fields we want to update as a value. This method will update the first record that matches the provided filter.

db.RecordsDB.updateOne({name: "Marsh"}, {$set:{ownerAddress: "451 W. Coffee St. A204"}})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993a2ce6e8850d88270b7"), "name" : "Marsh", "age" : "6 years", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "451 W. Coffee St. A204", "chipped" : true }
updateMany()
updateMany() allows us to update multiple items by passing in a list of items, just as we did when inserting multiple items. This update operation uses the same syntax for updating a single document.

db.RecordsDB.updateMany({species:"Dog"}, {$set: {age: "5"}})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 3, "modifiedCount" : 3 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years", "species" : "Cat", "ownerAddress" : "521 E. Cortland", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993a2ce6e8850d88270b7"), "name" : "Marsh", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "451 W. Coffee St. A204", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993f3ce6e8850d88270b8"), "name" : "Loo", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "380 W. Fir Ave", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd994efce6e8850d88270ba"), "name" : "Kevin", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "900 W. Wood Way", "chipped" : true }
replaceOne()
The replaceOne() method is used to replace a single document in the specified collection. replaceOne() replaces the entire document, meaning fields in the old document not contained in the new will be lost.

db.RecordsDB.replaceOne({name: "Kevin"}, {name: "Maki"})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years", "species" : "Cat", "ownerAddress" : "521 E. Cortland", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993a2ce6e8850d88270b7"), "name" : "Marsh", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "451 W. Coffee St. A204", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993f3ce6e8850d88270b8"), "name" : "Loo", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "380 W. Fir Ave", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd994efce6e8850d88270ba"), "name" : "Maki" }
Delete Operations
Delete operations operate on a single collection, like update and create operations. Delete operations are also atomic for a single document. You can provide delete operations with filters and criteria in order to specify which documents you would like to delete from a collection. The filter options rely on the same syntax that read operations utilize.

MongoDB has two different methods of deleting records from a collection:

db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()
deleteOne()
deleteOne() is used to remove a document from a specified collection on the MongoDB server. A filter criteria is used to specify the item to delete. It deletes the first record that matches the provided filter.

db.RecordsDB.deleteOne({name:"Maki"})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years", "species" : "Cat", "ownerAddress" : "521 E. Cortland", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993a2ce6e8850d88270b7"), "name" : "Marsh", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "451 W. Coffee St. A204", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993f3ce6e8850d88270b8"), "name" : "Loo", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "380 W. Fir Ave", "chipped" : true }
deleteMany()
deleteMany() is a method used to delete multiple documents from a desired collection with a single delete operation. A list is passed into the method and the individual items are defined with filter criteria as in deleteOne().

db.RecordsDB.deleteMany({species:"Dog"})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 2 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years", "species" : "Cat",
